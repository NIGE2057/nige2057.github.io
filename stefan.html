  <h1>Stefan, the Troll and Prankster</h1>
  <p>Stefan was a troll and a prankster who played pranks every day. One day, he decided to play his biggest prank by building a large wooden bridge over a river. The people would think the bridge is strong enough to cross, but in reality, it would collapse and drop them into the water.</p>
  <div class="game-container">
    <p>Can you cross the bridge without falling into the water?</p>
    <div id="bridge"></div>
    <div id="character"></div>
    <button id="start-game-btn">Start the game</button>
    <div id="game-result"></div>
  </div>

    startGameBtn.addEventListener("click", function() {
      const randomNumber = Math.random();
      if (randomNumber > 0.5) {
        gameResult.innerHTML = "Congratulations! You made it across the bridge safely.";
        character.style.bottom = "50px";
